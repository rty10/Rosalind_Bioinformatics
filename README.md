# Rosalind_Bioinformatics
The contents of this repository are Python3 coding notebooks and datasets used in working with the Rosalind.info work.

## The repository
This repository stores all notebooks and datasets completed from rosalind.info, a project designed to teach and offer problems focusing on bioinformatics (https://rosalind.info/about/).

My username on rosalind.info: robb.young.2011
Feel free to look over notebooks for code examples.
All data found in the `datasets` directory are randomly generated as needed by rosalind.info

## Latest update
26 Nov 2021: Generated this respository and uploaded the first three notebooks used to answer the 'Counting DNA Nucleotides', 'Transcribing DNA into RNA', and 'Complementing a Strand of DNA' problems.
- "nb001": solution code to 'Counting DNA Nucleotides'
- "nb002": solution code to 'Transcribing DNA into RNA'
- "nb003": solution code to 'Complementing a Strand of DNA'
