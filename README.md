# Rosalind Bioinformatics
The contents of this repository are Python3 coding notebooks and datasets used in working with the Rosalind.info work.

## The repository
This repository stores all notebooks and datasets completed from rosalind.info, a project designed to teach and offer problems focusing on bioinformatics (https://rosalind.info/about/).

My username on rosalind.info: `robb.young.2011`

Feel free to look over notebooks for code examples.
All data found in the `datasets` directory are randomly generated as needed by rosalind.info

## Latest update
16 Dec 2024:
As there are multiple problem solving sections to this website, I've updated the `main` branch to include two directories: `armory` and `stronghold`, as named based on the Rosalind.info website.
- The `stronghold` problems are further organized based on the problem tree structure from the website.
- Completed the 'CONS' problem in Level 2 of the `stronghold` section with two attempts.


You can find the full list of all available `Problems` at https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/.
