# Rosalind_Bioinformatics
The contents of this repository are Python3 coding notebooks and datasets used in working with the Rosalind.info work.

## The repository
This repository stores all notebooks and datasets completed from rosalind.info, a project designed to teach and offer problems focusing on bioinformatics (https://rosalind.info/about/).

My username on rosalind.info: `robb.young.2011`

Feel free to look over notebooks for code examples.
All data found in the `datasets` directory are randomly generated as needed by rosalind.info
